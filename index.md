# Knowledge Pixels Demo at Opendata.ch 2023 Forum

## 1. Establish your identity with ORCID

You will need an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) account for this hands-on demo.

[Register](https://orcid.org/register), if you don't have one already.

## 2. Publish a piece of open data with Nanodash

Go to [Nanodash](https://nanodash.petapico.org/publish?template=http://purl.org/np/RA6p8TsYKPUmy6yoKuxjBKn2vRKczjIWrcS2lyyX61myE&template-version=latest).

(In case there are problems with the link above, there is [another Nanodash instance](https://nanodash.np.trustyuri.net/publish?template=http://purl.org/np/RA6p8TsYKPUmy6yoKuxjBKn2vRKczjIWrcS2lyyX61myE&template-version=latest).)

Nanodash will ask you to login with ORCID first. The link then leads you to the form where you can publish your opinion about something that is over- or underrated.
